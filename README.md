Cpsc 233 Pacman

Running Demo 2/3(GUI version)
To run PacMan GUI version, import all the files under the WorkingGUI branch in 
in GIT into an eclipse project. Assuming javaFX is installed run the 
file "FXgame.java". The GIF and the wall image must be under the same package, we used a default package.
This will begin the sequences and a GUI screen should appear.
Move Pacman around with the arrow keys.
