# PacmanProject
Cpsc 233 Pacman
>>>>>>> master
Running Demo 2/3(GUI version)
To run PacMan GUI version, import all the files under the WorkingGUI branch in 
in GIT into an eclipse project. Assuming javaFX is installed run the 
file "FXgame.java". The GIF and the wall image must be under the same package, we used a default package.
This will begin the sequences and a GUI screen should appear.
Move Pacman around with the arrow keys.
If the screen is cut off, it is because the resolution GUI is created for a 1920 x 1080 monitor, your monitor
resolution is printed in the console if you run the program. Edit the screenWidth to be the larger number printed in console
and the screenHeight to be the smaller number in console to get the correct fit for your screen.
