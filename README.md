Cpsc 233 Pacman
>>>>>>> master

This repo contains PacMan in two different versions: Text and GUI. Both of them require JavaFX to be installed and working on your system.
So please install Javafx before following the instructions below. Both versions have a score and highscore tracker. 



Running GUI Version

To run PacMan GUI version, import all the files under the main branch in GIT into an eclipse project. Assuming javaFX is installed run the 
file "FXgame.java". All .GIF and .JPG files must be under the same package, we used a default package.
This will begin the sequences and a GUI screen should appear.
Move Pacman around with the arrow keys and avoid the ghost, if you are caught you will have the option to restart



Running Console Text Version

To run the the text version, follow the same instructions as for the GUI version but run the file TextGame.java instead.
