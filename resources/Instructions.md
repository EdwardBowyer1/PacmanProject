This file describes how to play the game and run the J-Unit tests
See the README to first get the game running 

GUI version:

To play, use the arrow keys to move Pacman around. Eat the food items to increase your score. If you die you can retry
and try to beat your highscore. 
There is collision detection in the game, your are not allowed to enter walls, which you can test by trying to enter a 
wall. Food items disappear if Pacman "eats" them.

Text Version:

To plya follow instructions that are printed on the screen, same rules apply as the GUI version as they are based on the
same code.

Running J-Unit tests:

We have provided several J-Unit tests to to test the functionality of the logic. To run them make sure you import the our
files into a single package and have J-Unit version 4 running. Then simply run each test class to see how our code is tested.
